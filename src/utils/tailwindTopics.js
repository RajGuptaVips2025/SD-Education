        headContent: "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with predefined components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.\n\nTailwind CSS emphasizes a utility-first approach to styling, allowing developers to apply styles directly in their markup, resulting in a highly productive development workflow. It also supports responsive design with utility variants for different screen sizes, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.",
